## **Summary:**
### The goal of this research is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying antisemitic texts.<br>
### To achieve this objective, we utilize both publicly available labeled datasets and custom datasets composed of Reddit posts and comments that we collected from various subreddits and manually annotated.<br>
### Texts containing at least one of the predefined keywords are labeled as antisemitic, while those that do not are considered benign.<br>
### While this keyword-based approach has its limitations, this research also explores alternative methods for dataset annotation.<br>
### At the end we integrated our best model with a Telegram Bot that is able to determin if a given text is antisemitic or not.
